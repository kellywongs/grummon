#whitney grummon memorial memorial


##changelog:

- *tuesday july 3 2018*
	- wow you missed a lot from monday, a lot has happened
	- entire site is pretty much up, made a cool gradient that i really like on scroll, minimalist approach with a subtle loading animation
	- vertical centering DOES WORK OCCASIONALLY

- *monday july 2 2018*
	- created index sheets with terminal because haha i'm lazy
	- interesting cost/benefit ratio because i immediately realized i hadn't worked with terminal since the Youth Music Monterey project and had to google a cheatsheet whoops
	- starting work on the page, finished around 20 post-its and ready for implementation, or at least the beginning

- *sunday july 1 2018*
	- working on some concepts right now, ‘clarity’ — without the map — seems the most workable at the moment
