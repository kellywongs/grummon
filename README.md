##changelog:

- monday july 2 2018
	- created index sheets with terminal because haha i'm lazy
	- interesting cost/benefit ratio because i immediately realized i hadn't worked with terminal since the Youth Music Monterey project and had to google a cheatsheet whoops
	- starting work on the page, finished around 20 post-its and ready for implementation, or at least the beginning

- sunday july 1 2018
	- working on some concepts right now, ‘clarity’ — without the map — seems the most workable at the moment
